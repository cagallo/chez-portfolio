            I am a creative and resourceful software developer with a superior
            knack for problem solving and the ability to design, build and deliver
            quality software applications that meet the needs of the user. A team
            can count on me to have a considerable knowledge of web development,
            as well as the attitude and enthusiasm that it takes to create an
            exemplary application.

          <p className="about-paragraph">
            As a software developer, I care immensely about design aspects such as
            accessibility. I strive to create tech with a diverse and inclusive
            team because I truly think the most powerful work is performed when
            one is surrounded by a progressive and visionary group of individuals.
            I hope to combine my love of problem solving with my liberal arts
            background in a creative manner that results in the production of
            innovative and inspiring code that positively impacts the world.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            I have an academic background in English Literature and I possess a
            breadth of experience ranging from owning and administrating a small
            business to being a private pilot. Before delving into software
            development, I was an office administrator for a small hotel software
            startup in Denver. Once I was exposed to the tech worldâ€”I was hooked!
            I loved that we were able to literally create anything through
            programming, using simply a keyboard. Additionally, I ran a small
            commercial printing business after graduating college and deeply
            enjoyed the ability to develop close relationships with our many
            repeat clients and the opportunities for innovation.
          </p>
          <p className="about-paragraph">
            In my spare time, I enjoy reading, poker, flying Cessnas and playing
            in the mountains. Feel free out to me with any questions!{" "}
